Project 1 for Udacity Full Stack Nanodegree

This project uses classes to make a webpage of some of my favorite movies.
To generate the webpage, simply run the "entertainment_center.py" file in Python.

media.py: contains information about the class Movie
fresh_tomatoes.py: handles generation of the webpage
entertainment_center.py: creates instances of the class Movie and initiates creation of the page
